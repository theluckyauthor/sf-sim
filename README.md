# SF SIM – Technical Design Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Author:** [Your Name]

## 1. Overview

**Purpose & Vision:**  
SF SIM is a 2D, text-based web game that immerses players in the life of a San Francisco founder. The game focuses on narrative-driven gameplay with decision-making elements, simulating the ups and downs of startup life in a dynamic, real-world inspired cityscape. The goal is to provide an engaging simulation experience with flexibility for future expansion (e.g., adding more events, deeper simulation mechanics, or additional media elements).

**Target Audience:**  
- Aspiring entrepreneurs  
- Fans of simulation and narrative games  
- Players interested in startup culture and San Francisco’s tech scene

## 2. Game Concept & Core Mechanics

### Narrative & Simulation
- **Storyline:**  
  The player takes on the role of a founder in San Francisco, managing both professional challenges (fundraising, product development, market competition) and personal life (relationships, stress, work-life balance).  
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**  
  - **Decision Points:** Text-based prompts present choices that influence the narrative and game state.
  - **Random Events:** Simulated events (e.g., unexpected market changes, investor meetings) occur to keep the gameplay dynamic.
  - **Resource Management:** The game tracks variables such as cash, reputation, stress, and time—affecting the founder’s journey.
  - **2D Visual Elements:** While primarily text-based, simple 2D graphics (icons, minimal animations) depict key scenes, locations, and status changes.

### Flexibility
- **Modularity:**  
  - Use configuration files (JSON or YAML) to define events, outcomes, and narrative branches.
  - Ensure game logic is decoupled from presentation to facilitate adding new content.
- **Extensibility:**  
  - The design should allow future integrations such as more detailed UI elements, sound effects, and potential multiplayer features.

## 3. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
- **Client-Server Model:**  
  - **Frontend:** Runs in the browser, handles UI rendering, game logic, and user interaction.
  - **Backend (Optional/As Needed):** Manages persistent data (player progress, game state) and may serve as the API endpoint for future multiplayer or cloud-save features.
- **Communication:**  
  - Use RESTful API endpoints (or GraphQL if preferred) for saving/loading game state.
  - For real-time updates or potential future multiplayer interactions, consider integrating WebSockets.

## 4. Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Language & Frameworks:**  
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
  - **Optional Framework:** React or Vue.js for robust state management and component-based design
- **2D Rendering:**  
  - Use a lightweight game framework such as [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) or [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) to handle 2D graphics and animations.
- **State Management:**  
  - Redux (if using React) or Vuex (if using Vue.js) for handling game state, especially for complex decision trees and event handling.

### Backend
- **Server Environment:**  
  - Node.js with Express for REST API endpoints.
- **Database:**  
  - MongoDB (or Firebase if you prefer a serverless solution) for saving player progress and dynamic game data.
- **Deployment:**  
  - Containerized deployment using Docker; CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar.

### Tools & Build
- **Bundlers & Transpilers:**  
  - Webpack or Vite for module bundling
  - Babel for JavaScript transpilation (if using modern ES6+ features)
- **Testing Frameworks:**  
  - Jest/Mocha for unit tests; integration tests for API endpoints and UI interactions.

## 5. Game Engine & Game Loop

### Core Loop
1. **Input Phase:**  
   - Capture user inputs (keyboard/mouse clicks) for decision points.
2. **Update Phase:**  
   - Process the selected decision; update game state variables (cash, stress, reputation, etc.).
   - Trigger random events or narrative branches.
3. **Render Phase:**  
   - Update text panels and 2D visual elements on the canvas.
   - Provide feedback on state changes and next available actions.

### Modular Game Logic
- **Event Manager:**  
  - A dedicated module that reads event configurations from JSON files and determines which events to trigger based on game state.
- **State Manager:**  
  - Manages overall game state using a centralized store, ensuring easy access and update across components.
- **UI Manager:**  
  - Handles rendering text narratives and basic 2D graphics, ensuring a clean separation between game logic and presentation.

## 6. User Interface (UI) Design

### Layout & Components
- **Main Game Screen:**  
  - **Text Panel:** Central area for narrative and decision prompts.
  - **Status Panel:** Displays current metrics (cash, reputation, stress, time).
  - **2D Map/Scene View:** A minimalist visual representation of San Francisco with icons for key locations (e.g., coworking spaces, VC offices).
- **Navigation:**  
  - User input primarily via keyboard and mouse clicks.
  - Responsive design to cater to both desktop and mobile web browsers.

### UX Considerations
- **Readability:**  
  - Choose legible fonts and maintain high contrast between text and background.
- **Feedback:**  
  - Immediate visual and auditory feedback for player actions (e.g., subtle animations or sound cues when a decision is made).
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure the game supports screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

## 7. Data Persistence & API Design

### Persistence
- **Local Storage:**  
  - Temporary game state storage for session recovery.
- **Server-Side Storage:**  
  - Persist player progress, settings, and historical game logs in a database (e.g., MongoDB).

### API Endpoints (if using a backend)
- **GET /game/state:**  
  - Retrieve current game state for the player.
- **POST /game/update:**  
  - Submit updates to the game state after a decision.
- **POST /game/save:**  
  - Save progress periodically or at key milestones.
- **GET /events/config:**  
  - Retrieve current event configurations (allowing dynamic updates without redeployment).

---

## 8. Flexibility & Extensibility

- **Modular Code Structure:**  
  - Isolate game logic, UI components, and backend services to allow easy modifications and feature additions.
- **Configuration Driven:**  
  - Use JSON/YAML files to define events, narrative branches, and resource parameters, enabling non-engineers (e.g., game designers) to tweak gameplay without modifying core code.
- **Future Features:**  
  - Potential for multiplayer or cooperative play.
  - In-app purchases or premium content modules.
  - Expansion packs with new narratives and SF locales.

---

## 9. Testing & Deployment

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Cover core game logic, state transitions, and event triggers.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Test API endpoints and client-server interactions.
- **UI/UX Testing:**  
  - Conduct usability tests to ensure narrative clarity and intuitive controls.

### Deployment
- **Staging & Production Environments:**  
  - Use Docker containers for consistency across environments.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:**  
  - Set up automated pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for testing and deploying updates.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Integrate tools to monitor game performance and error logging (e.g., Sentry).
